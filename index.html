    <p>The popularity and consumption of matcha has been skyrocketing over the past couple of years and is accessible now in the majority of cafes and supermarkets around the US. Though the product itself is well-known, many are unaware of exactly where matcha comes from as well as the <em>meticulous process</em> of growing its green tea leaves in a farm into to its dry, high-demand powder form that is sold all over the world.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>"Matcha tea is a Japanese green tea made by finely grinding young tea leaves into a bright green powder. While the art of drinking tea has been a part of Japanese culture for centuries, matcha tea has become a unique and prominent part of Japan's cultural identity. With its <em>rich history and cultural significance</em>, matcha tea continues to be enjoyed by people all over the world."</li>

        <li>"Matcha tea is not just a beverage but an <strong>essential part of Japanese culture</strong>. In fact, the Japanese have designated matcha tea as a "cultural treasure," It is used in various traditional ceremonies, including weddings, funerals, and other special events. Matcha tea is also used in Japanese culinary arts, such as making matcha-flavored ice cream and mochi."</li>
      </ul>
