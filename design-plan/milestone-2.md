# Project 1, Milestone 2: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Example Website CSS Property Analysis

For each example website you identified in milestone 1:

1. Include the same screenshot of the example website you included in Milestone 1.
2. Identify 2 parts of the design that you want to analyze for CSS properties.
3. For each part of the design, list the CSS properties for shape, color, and typography that you might use to create a similar design on your personal website.

## CSS Styling Plan
> Pick one of the examples websites to use as inspiration to begin styling your personal website.
> Explain why you chose the example website and how you plan to use it as inspiration for styling your personal website.

- I chose my second website.

- I chose this website because it utilizes different font-weights and styles to bring out specific information like the headings. I will bring more attention to my headings as well.
